# HumanActivityRecognition
The main objective of the project is to evaluate different ML model performances on HAR dataset

**Models used:** 

Knn(baseline model)

Logistic Regression with Elastic Net

SVM with RBF kernel

Random Forest.

**Tools used:**

Pandas and Numpy for preprocessing

Scikit-learn for scaling and model building

Matplotlib for performance visualisation.

**Performance:**
Support Vector Machines (with RBF kernel) performed highest with over 96% accuracy in recognizing human activity.
